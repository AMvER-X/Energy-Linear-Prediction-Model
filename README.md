# Energy-Linear-Prediction-Model
This project is a detailed Linear Regression task focused on predicting monthly residential energy consumption.

Primary Objectives:

Rigorous Data Pre-processing: To develop expertise in advanced data cleaning techniques, specifically handling multicollinearity using VIF scores , correcting categorical errors using Levenshtein distance , managing outliers via z-scores , and correcting inconsistent data types.


Strategic Pipeline Development: To build a robust machine learning pipeline featuring specialized components for imputation (using mean, median, or unknown categories) , feature engineering (creating custom density ratios) , and scaling.


Model Selection and Diagnosis: To select an appropriate model, XGBRegressor, capable of detecting non-linear relationships. Crucially, the project's analysis served to diagnose poor predictive performance stemming from poor data quality, demonstrating the ability to differentiate between modeling failures and inherent dataset limitations.
